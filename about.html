    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm TÃ¢n Pham, currently residing in Alkmaar, the Netherlands. My creative journey has been diverse and started early on, encompassing not just photo editing but also video production, photography, and a musical background with the violin and guitar. This was the turning point when everything visually captivating truly captivated me. 
            Years ago, I embarked on a transformative path when I enrolled in a media school, specializing in AudioVisueel. During my time there, I delved deep into the world of filmmaking and media production, gaining valuable insights into the art of bringing stories and films to life. 
            While I had always been engrossed in creative pursuits during my free time, there was one tool that had eluded me: Photoshop. Or rather, I knew of its existence but didn't quite appreciate it until covid happened and we were isolated alone, It only took an hour of experimenting with Photoshop for me to fall head over heels in love with its creative potential. Unfortunately, my formal education didn't let us explore the deeps of Photoshop, so I took it upon myself to master it through extensive practice.
            Primarily, I consider myself a photographer with a secondary passion for digital artistry. I'm perpetually on the lookout for ways to enhance my skills, refine my work, and uplift those around me, all while maintaining a positive and enthusiastic attitude.
            Let's collaborate and make something remarkable happen together!
