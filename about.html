            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Hello! I'm TÃ¢n Pham, currently residing in Alkmaar, the Netherlands.</h2>
            <p> My creative journey has been a diverse journey and started quite early on everything visually appealing truly captivates me. Starting with photography and my first camera from my father and over the years I've slowly honed my skills as a photographer.</p>
            <p> Years ago, I embarked on a transformative path when I enrolled in a school that specializes in media, and studied Audio visual design. During my time there, I delved deep into the world of filmmaking and media production, gaining valuable insights into the art of bringing stories and films to life. </p>
            <p> While I had always been engrossed in creative pursuits during my free time, there was this one tool intrigued and scared me at the same time: Photoshop. Or rather, I knew of its existence but didn't quite appreciate it until covid happened and we were isolated alone for quite some time, It only took an hour of experimenting with Photoshop for me to fall head over heels in love with its creative potential. Unfortunately, my schools education system didn't let us explore the deeps of Photoshop, so I took it upon myself to master it through extensive practice.</p>
            <p>Primarily, I consider myself a photographer with a secondary passion for digital artistry. I'm perpetually on the lookout for ways to enhance my skills, refine my work, and uplift those around me, all while maintaining a positive and enthusiastic attitude.
            Let's collaborate and make something remarkable happen together!</p>
